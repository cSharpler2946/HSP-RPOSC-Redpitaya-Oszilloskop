To stay under the 100MiB file size limit of GRIPS, we've had to aggressively compress the video.
The file "HSP-Vorf√ºhrung_h264_20" uses the h.264 codec.
The h.264 encoder under Linux seems to yield quite poor results when it comes to how the text looks, but it is compatible with any playback device.
The other file uses h.265 (HEVC) and looks much better, but compatibility is worse.
The h.265 encoded file can be played back with VLC Media Player, but we can't guarantee compatibility with other playback software.
